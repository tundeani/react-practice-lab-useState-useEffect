# React Projects Playground

Welcome to **React Projects Playground** – a beginner-friendly React app designed to help developers understand and experiment with React Hooks, particularly `useState` and `useEffect`.

This project is structured with multiple mini-projects demonstrating real-world use cases of these hooks. Each app is isolated, responsive, and styled individually to enhance clarity and learning.
